# TcNo-Random-Scripts
Just a collection of scripts I've created/compiled that I find useful.

Code sourced from all around, but most of the work is mine.
Some of these scripts are ancient, but most of them still work.
Some of these are more just for fun or learning. If you find something you'll use, great.

Sharing these is a much better use than sitting in a backed up folder somewhere on my computer.
